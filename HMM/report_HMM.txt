My assignment of POS tagging is based on HMM model that I implemented from scratch.
So, it's a little rough.

The acc on test set is: 84.1%

Explanation:
    1. block 1 is to read data by util implemented by me.
    2. block 2 is to clean data, specifically, I adopted the method mentioned by SLP book to deal with UNK.
    3. block 3 is training process.
    4. block 4 is to read test data
    5. block 5 is to test model
        5.1. replacing the unkown token with UNK which trained in training.
        5.2. based on vertibi algorithm to search the path.
