My assignment of POS tagging is based on shiftreduce algorithm and Perceptron model with unigram feature.
My logic follows slides of Neubig Sensei.

The acc on test set is: 54.9%

Explanation:
    1. block 1 is to read and format data by utils implemented by me.
    2. block 2 is to combine features.
    3. block 3 is to define methods for computing and training.
    4. block 4 is to train the perceptron. BTW, maybe train 3-5 epochs could have a better result.
    5. block 5 is to test based on the shiftreduce algorithm.
